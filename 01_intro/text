Introduction to Java Streams:
"Welcome to 'Mastering Java Streams: Practical Guide.'
In this course, we'll dive deep into one of the most powerful and versatile Java features - StreamsAPI.
But what are Java Streams? Let's find out."

Why Java Streams?
"Java Streams were introduced to address the need for a more elegant and expressive way of working with data and collections.
They are a key component in shifting your code from imperative to functional style, where you express what you want to do with data, not how to do it."

External vs. Internal Iteration:
"In imperative style of coding for example by using for-each loops, you explicitly control each step of the iteration.
In contrast, Java Streams encourage a functional style, where the iteration is abstracted away, and you express what you want to do with the data and letting the Streams API handle the 'how'-part."

Benefits of Internal Iteration:
"Let's take a look at the comparison of both approches in simple.
Consider filtering a list of numbers to find all even ones - this is a really book example.

In an imperative style, it might look like this:

List<Integer> numbers = Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);
List<Integer> evenNumbers = new ArrayList<>();
for (int number : numbers) {
    if (number % 2 == 0) {
        evenNumbers.add(number);
    }
}

Now, in a functional style with Java Streams, you can achieve the same result more elegantly:

List<Integer> numbers = Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);
List<Integer> evenNumbers =
 numbers.stream()
        .filter(n -> n % 2 == 0)
        .collect(Collectors.toList());

Course Overview:
In this course we'll cover the basics of Java Streams, dive into all operations Streams API offers, and explore advanced concepts like parallel streams.
So let's dive in.
